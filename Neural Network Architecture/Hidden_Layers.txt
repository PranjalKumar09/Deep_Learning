Hidden layers
---------------

* ANN (artificial neural network) can have one or more hidden layers.
* Each hidden layer can have one or more nodes (or perceptron) (count in 2n)


Inputs & Outputs
-----------------

* The output of each node in the previous layer becomes the input for each node in current layer (fully connected)
* Each node preodcues one output that is forwarded to next layer



Determining Hidden Layer Architecture
------------------------------------
* Each node learns something about feature target relationship
* More nodes & layers mean
    Web application on AWS
    Analytics on GCP
* Architecture decided by experimentation
