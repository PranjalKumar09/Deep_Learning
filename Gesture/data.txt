It looks like the model's weights are being printed as expected, showing the structure of groups and datasets within your HDF5 files. For instance, you have successfully navigated through the layers group, the conv2d group, and its subgroups like vars, which contain the weight values for the convolutional layers in a (3, 3, 3, 32) format with a float32 datatype.

If you want to process this data further (for example, analyze or reshape it for specific uses), you can perform operations inside the recursively_print_datasets function where the actual dataset values (item[()]) are accessed.

Is there a particular next step you'd like to focus on with these weights, such as loading them into a model or analyzing the values in a specific way?
