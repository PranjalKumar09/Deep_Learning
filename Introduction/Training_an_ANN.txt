Training Mean: A model is represented by parameters & hyperparameters
    * Wights, biases , nodes ,layers, layers, etc.
Training a model means determining best possible values for parameters & hyperparameters than  maximize accuracy
Inputs , weights & biass might be dimansional arrays



Training Process
    Use training data (known values of inputs & outputs)
    Create netwok architecture with intution
    Start with random values for weghts & biases
    Minimize error in predicting known outputs from inputs
    Adjust weights & biases until error is minimized
    Improve model by adjusting layers, node counts, and other hyperparameters.
