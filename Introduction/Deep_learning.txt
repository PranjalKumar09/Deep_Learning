Deep Learning
    * SubSet of ML
    * Neutral Network with three or four layers 
    * Imitates how humans process data or make decisions
    * Powered by advances in large scale data processing  & interface


Application
    * NLP
    * Speec recongnitoin
    * Image recongnitoin
    * Self driving cars


Perceptron
    * An algorithm for supervised learning for binary classification
    * Resemble cell in human brain
    * A single cell neural network
    * Perceptron are called nodes in neural network
    * Nodes organized as layers
    * Each node has weight , bias ans Activation function.

Perceptron formula 
    y = f(a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + (an)(xn) + b )
                 |
                \|/

    w : weight
    b : bias
    f : Activation function
